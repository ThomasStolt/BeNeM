## Features

### Feature: Incident List
**Status:** shipped-ios, in-progress-pwa
**API:** `POST /api/incident_api.php` (method=getincidents)

#### Behaviour (both platforms)
- Display open incidents
- Swipe gestures for acknowledge / unacknowledge
- Pull-to-refresh and 120-second auto-refresh
- Navigate to incident detail on tap
- Badge with alarm state counts from `getincidentdetail` (`primary_alarm_log` + `relatedalarms`)

#### iOS-specific
- SwiftUI `List` with native swipe actions (right = ACK, left = UnACK)
- Auto-refresh countdown ring in the toolbar (`AutoRefreshButton`)

#### PWA-specific
- v0.1.0: read-only list, 120s auto-refresh, pull-to-refresh, tap navigates to detail stub
- v0.1.0.5: hosted at `https://benem.hurrikap.org` as a dedicated container alongside the middleware; minimal Settings screen for BHNM API key entry (localStorage)
- v0.1.1: real incident detail screen (essentials: metadata + ACK action), swipe ACK/UnACK on list rows, polished Settings with PIN + test-connection via ha_status endpoint
- Pull-to-refresh is hand-rolled in `components/PullToRefresh.tsx`; row swipe gestures use `react-swipeable`
